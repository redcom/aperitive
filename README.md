# Aperitive wants to be a starter based on Apollo Stack.
A starter for developing react, graphql, apollo applications. Based on apollo-fullstack-starter-kit. — Edit


## Getting Started

1. Read [README-STARTER] for quick start.

## Additions added to the starter

- Docker based database. Mongodb in addition to sqlite.

  ```
  cd tools && docker-machine up
  ```
It reads docker-compose.yml and starts a container with Mongodb

- Flow-typed

  ```
  flow-typed install
  ```
  Install interfaces/libdef for found modules in package.json

### Read [TODO] for a list of items you can find in this project

I choose Aperitive name because it has a stimulating effect on the appetite for coding dreams.
