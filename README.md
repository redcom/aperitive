## Getting Started

1. Read [README-STARTER] for quick start.

## Additions added to the starter

- Docker based database. Mongodb in addition to sqlite.

  ```
  cd tools && docker-machine up
  ```
It reads docker-compose.yml and starts a container with Mongodb

  ```
  flow-typed install
  ```
  Install interfaces/libdef for found modules in package.json

### Read [TODO] for a list of items you can find in this project
